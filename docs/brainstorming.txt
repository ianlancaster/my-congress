NOTES:
  the application should allow as many features as possible without log-in
  most bills die in committee because they never make it onto the agenda. This may not result in a change in status of the bill and thus trigger no notification. A timeout could be used to address this
  there are various 'social' design choices that can be made to improve the quality of the app. For instance, I may only allow a user to express their support of a bill from the bill details screen, perhaps even at the bottom of this screen. This ensures that the user has atleast scrolled over the bill summary content, and have had a chance to see comments and news before expressing their opinion. Hopfully this design will encourage more informed decisions
